# MajorProjectFinalReport
This is a repository for our major project final report. The project basically creates two dimensional drawings. We targeted Civil engineers who have a hard time in making drawings using paper sheets. We focused on making the interface user friendly so that it can be used even by layman. 
The project is completely open source and we have used C++, LibreCAD and libdxf library. Apart from that we have also provided the documentation and a user manual which will help those people who will use it for the first time.
